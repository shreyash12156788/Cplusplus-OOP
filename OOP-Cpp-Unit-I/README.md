List of Programs

1. Soil Sensor Monitoring System

2. Student Attendance Management System

3. Product Catalog Management System


1. Soil Sensor Monitoring System

Brief Description:

- This program is designed to store and manage soil sensor readings.

- It creates a class named SoilSensor to represent the information collected from a soil sensor.

- Each sensor contains a unique sensor ID, moisture level, and timestamp.

- The sensor ID is stored using a string variable.

- The moisture level is stored using a double data type because it can contain decimal values.

- The timestamp is stored as a string to represent the time of the sensor reading.

- Private data members are used to protect the sensor information.

- A constructor is used to initialize the sensor ID, moisture level, and timestamp.

- The readSensor() function is used to update the moisture level and reading time.

- The displayData() function is used to display the sensor information.

- A vector is used to store multiple SoilSensor objects.

- The emplace_back() function is used to add sensor objects directly into the vector.

- A for loop is used to access and display each sensor stored in the vector.

- The program updates the reading of the first sensor using the readSensor() function.

- The program demonstrates classes, objects, constructors, encapsulation, vectors, and member functions.

- The const keyword is used with displayData() because the function does not modify the sensor object.

- The final output displays the morning readings of all sensors and the updated reading of the first sensor.


2. Student Attendance Management System

Brief Description:

- This program is designed to manage and calculate student attendance.

- A class named Student is created to store and manage student attendance information.

- Each student contains a roll number, name, total attendance days, and present days.

- The roll number is stored using an integer variable.

- The student name is stored using a string variable.

- Private data members are used to protect the student information.

- A constructor is used to initialize the student's roll number and name.

- The totalDays and presentDays variables are initially set to zero.

- The markAttendance() function is used to record whether the student is present or absent.

- A bool value is used to represent the attendance status.

- If the student is present, the presentDays count is increased.

- The totalDays count is increased every time attendance is marked.

- The getAttendancePercentage() function is used to calculate the student's attendance percentage.

- If no attendance is recorded, the function returns 0.0%.

- The attendance percentage is calculated using the formula:
  Present Days / Total Days × 100

- The display() function is used to display the student's roll number, name, and attendance percentage.

- Two Student objects are created to represent two different students.

- The program demonstrates classes, objects, constructors, encapsulation, conditional statements, functions, and boolean values.

- Constant member functions are used where the function does not modify the student data.

- The final output displays the attendance report of both students.


3. Product Catalog Management System

Brief Description:

- This program is designed to manage product information in a product catalog.

- A class named Product is created to represent product details.

- Each product contains a product ID, product name, price, and stock quantity.

- The product ID is stored using an integer variable.

- The product name is stored using a string variable.

- The price is stored using a double data type.

- The stock quantity is stored using an integer variable.

- Private data members are used to protect the product information.

- A constructor is used to initialize the product details.

- A static variable named totalProducts is used to keep track of the total number of Product objects.

- The totalProducts value is increased whenever a new Product object is created.

- Inline functions are used to return the product ID, product name, and price.

- The updateStock() function is used to update the available stock quantity.

- The static getTotalProducts() function is used to return the total number of products.

- The display() function is used to display the product ID, name, price, and stock quantity.

- A destructor is used to decrease the totalProducts count when a Product object is destroyed.

- The static data member is initialized outside the class with an initial value of zero.

- Three Product objects are created for Laptop, Mouse, and Keyboard.

- The program demonstrates classes, objects, constructors, destructors, encapsulation, static data members, static member functions, and inline functions.

- The program also demonstrates how a static data member can be shared by all objects of a class.

- The final output displays the product catalog and the total number of products.
